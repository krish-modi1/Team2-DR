build_json_bruteforce.py
Generate P_win/P_draw JSON by brute force (no symmetry reduction).
Definition:
- For each ply p and role r âˆˆ {X,O}, we average over ALL legal boards with exactly p moves,
  where it's r's turn to play (X moves at even p).
- For each empty cell c in those boards, we compute the probability that r eventually
  WINS or DRAWS if r first plays at c and thereafter BOTH players pick uniformly
  at random among legal moves until terminal.
- We then average these probabilities over the enumerated boards, ignoring boards
  where cell c is not empty.
- Output schema matches build_tables.py loader:
{
  "win":  {"X": {"ply_0": [[...NxN...], ...], "ply_1": ...}, "O": {...}},
  "draw": {"X": {...}, "O": {...}}
}

This is EXPENSIVE for large N/p. Practical for 3x3 (full plies). For 4x4, keep p small.
