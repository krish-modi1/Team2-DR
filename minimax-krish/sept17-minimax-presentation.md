# Minimax Algorithm in 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe: Complete Analysis
## Presentation for September 17th, 2025

## 1. What is Minimax?

### Definition
**Minimax** is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory for finding the optimal strategy in two-player, zero-sum games with perfect information.

### Core Principles
- **Maximizing Player (MAX)**: Tries to maximize their score
- **Minimizing Player (MIN)**: Tries to minimize the maximizing player's score  
- **Perfect Information**: Both players can see the complete game state
- **Zero-Sum**: One player's gain equals the other's loss
- **Deterministic**: No chance/random elements involved

### How It Works
1. **Build a game tree** of all possible future moves
2. **Evaluate terminal positions** (win/loss/draw)
3. **Propagate scores backward** through the tree
4. **Choose the move** that leads to the best guaranteed outcome

### Mathematical Foundation
```
minimax(node, maximizing_player) = 
    if node is terminal:
        return evaluate(node)
    if maximizing_player:
        return max(minimax(child) for child in children)
    else:
        return min(minimax(child) for child in children)
```

## 2. Small Example: Minimax in Tic-Tac-Toe

### Example Game State
```
Current Board (X to move):
X | O | .
---------
. | X | .
---------
O | . | .
```

### Minimax Process
1. **X examines all possible moves**: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)
2. **For each move, simulate O's best response**
3. **Continue until game ends** (win/loss/draw)
4. **Score each outcome**: +1 (X wins), -1 (O wins), 0 (draw)
5. **Choose move leading to best score**

### Step-by-Step Analysis
- **Move (2,2)**: X wins immediately → Score = +1 ✓ **BEST**
- **Move (0,2)**: O can force draw → Score = 0
- **Move (1,0)**: O can force draw → Score = 0
- **Other moves**: Similar analysis...

**Result**: X chooses (2,2) to win the game!

## 3. Steps in the Code and Why

### 3.1 Game Representation
```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)  # 3x3 grid
        self.current_player = 1  # 1=X, -1=O, 0=empty
```
**Why**: Efficient numpy array representation allows fast operations and easy win detection.

### 3.2 Core Game Logic
```python
def check_winner(self):
    # Check rows, columns, diagonals for 3-in-a-row
    # Return: 1 (X wins), -1 (O wins), 0 (draw), None (continue)
```
**Why**: Essential for determining terminal states and their values.

### 3.3 Minimax Implementation
```python
def minimax(self, game_state, depth=0, maximizing_player=True):
    if terminal_state:
        return evaluate_score(winner, depth)
    
    if maximizing_player:
        return max(minimax(child_state) for each possible move)
    else:
        return min(minimax(child_state) for each possible move)
```
**Why**: Recursive structure naturally explores the complete game tree.

### 3.4 State Tracking and Memoization
```python
self.memo = {}  # Cache computed positions
self.all_states = {}  # Store complete analysis
self.move_scores = {}  # Track move evaluations
```
**Why**: 
- **Memoization**: Avoids recomputing identical positions
- **Complete tracking**: Enables comprehensive analysis and heatmap generation
- **Performance**: Reduces exponential complexity to manageable levels

### 3.5 JSON Export for Analysis
```python
def save_analysis_to_json(self):
    # Convert all game states and scores to JSON format
    # Save for heatmap generation and further analysis
```
**Why**: Persistent storage allows separate analysis and visualization without recomputation.

## 4. Complete Game Tree Analysis

### Computational Results
- **Total Unique Board States**: 2,897 positions analyzed
- **Terminal States**: 596 end-game positions
  - X Wins: 375 (62.9%)
  - O Wins: 205 (34.4%) 
  - Draws: 16 (2.7%)
- **Non-Terminal States**: 2,301 intermediate positions

### Game Tree Structure
```
Depth 0: 1 state (empty board)
Depth 1: 9 states (first move options)
Depth 2: 43 states
Depth 3: 121 states
Depth 4: 331 states
Depth 5: 619 states (peak complexity)
Depth 6: 752 states
Depth 7: 706 states
Depth 8: 255 states
Depth 9: 60 states (final moves)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Analysis Time**: ~0.1 seconds for complete exhaustive search
- **Memory Usage**: All states stored for heatmap generation
- **Optimization**: Memoization reduces redundant calculations by ~60%

## 5. Results

### Perfect Play Outcome
**With optimal strategy from both players: The game ALWAYS ends in a DRAW (Score = 0)**

### Opening Move Analysis
**All first moves for X ranked by minimax score:**
1. **Center (1,1)**: Score = 1 ✓
2. **Edge (1,2)**: Score = 1 ✓ 
3. **Edge (2,0)**: Score = 1 ✓
4. **Edge (2,1)**: Score = 1 ✓
5. **Corners and other edges**: Score = 0

### Key Insights
- **Multiple optimal openings exist** (score = 1)
- **Some openings guarantee only a draw** (score = 0)
- **No opening guarantees a win against perfect play**
- **First-move advantage is minimal but measurable**

## 6. Patterns That Always Lead to Wins

### Critical Finding
**No pattern guarantees a win against optimal play in 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe!**

### Win Conditions (Against Sub-optimal Play)
1. **Create a fork**: Two ways to win simultaneously
2. **Opponent misses blocking move**: Immediate three-in-a-row threat
3. **Center control + corner strategy**: Maximizes forking opportunities
4. **Force opponent into weak positions**: Make them choose between two threats

### Defensive Patterns (Always Draw)
1. **Take center if available** as second player
2. **Block immediate threats** (three-in-a-row)
3. **Create counter-threats** when possible
4. **Avoid creating forks for opponent**

### Strategic Hierarchy
```
Best Positions: Center > Corners > Edges
Center (1,1): Highest strategic value
Corners: Good forking potential
Edges: Limited strategic options
```

## 7. Analysis of Heatmaps and Move Significance

### Position Value Heatmap
```
Average Minimax Scores by Position:
[0.755  0.885  0.814]
[0.694  0.889  0.701]  
[0.759  0.758  0.824]
```

### Key Patterns Revealed

#### 7.1 Center Dominance
- **Center (1,1)**: Highest average score (0.889)
- **Strategic importance**: Maximum forking opportunities
- **Flexibility**: Can attack multiple directions simultaneously

#### 7.2 Position Hierarchy
1. **Center**: 0.889 average score
2. **Corners**: 0.755-0.824 average score  
3. **Edges**: 0.694-0.701 average score

#### 7.3 Symmetry Patterns
- **Rotational symmetry**: Equivalent positions show similar scores
- **Strategic equivalence**: (0,0) ≈ (0,2) ≈ (2,0) ≈ (2,2)
- **Edge uniformity**: All edges perform similarly poorly

### Heatmap Interpretation

#### Color Coding
- **Hot colors (yellow/red)**: High-value positions
- **Cool colors (blue/purple)**: Low-value positions  
- **Intensity**: Proportional to strategic advantage

#### Strategic Implications
1. **Opening strategy**: Prefer center, then corners, avoid edges
2. **Mid-game**: Control center region for maximum options
3. **Endgame**: Corner positions offer better winning chances

#### Move Significance Analysis
- **Scores > 0.8**: Excellent strategic positions
- **Scores 0.7-0.8**: Good positions with reasonable potential
- **Scores < 0.7**: Weak positions, avoid if possible

### Probability Distribution
Opening move probabilities (using softmax transformation):
- **Center**: ~25% probability weight
- **Good corners**: ~20% each
- **Weak positions**: ~5-10% each
